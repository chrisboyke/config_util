# config_util.py

A utility script to read an .INI file, with some additional functionality thrown in, such as support for inherited configurations, etc.

I use this script just about everywhere, so it's in its own project.
To use any scripts that use this, add it to your PYTHONPATH, i.e.:

Download config_util.py to /opt/projects/config_util

then:

export PYTHON_PATH=/opt/projects/config_util
